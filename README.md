# Understanding the Document and Window Objects in JavaScript

## Overview

This project aims to clarify the differences between the `document` and `window` objects in JavaScript, essential components of the browser environment that play crucial roles in web development.

## Key Concepts

1. **Window Object**:
   - Represents the browser window.
   - Serves as the global context for JavaScript execution.
   - Manages browser features (e.g., `window.alert()`, `window.location`).

2. **Document Object**:
   - Represents the content of the web page.
   - Acts as the entry point to the DOM (Document Object Model).
   - Allows manipulation of HTML elements (e.g., `document.getElementById()`).

## Relationship
- The `document` object is a property of the `window` object, allowing interaction with the web page's content within the browser environment.
